# EvaTools for Rotation Clinching
Evaluation tools(Auswertungstool) for rotation clinching in Matlab

Rotation clinching is a new type of clinching developed by *utg* at TUM.

## Evaluation tool
```Auswertungstool.m``` is the main file for the evaluation of the simulation results from ABAQUS.
It should be used with ```Auswertungstool.fig``` and ```CP_Analyse.m```.

Interface of the Evaluation tool:

## Extration tool
```Kontur.m``` is the main file to extract the edge information. It should be used in conjuction with ```Kontur.fig```, ```Analysis.m``` and ```Analysis_SIMULATION.m```. The first file is the GUI file of the programm. The latter two are the analytical functions for the main file.

You can do the test with the attached picture.

The usage for Kontur.m will be updated later. Thanks for your interest.
