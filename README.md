# EvaTools for Rotation Clinching
Evaluation tools(Auswertungstool) for rotation clinching in Matlab

Rotation clinching is a new type of clinching developed by utg at TUM.

Auswertungstool.m is the main file for the evaluation of the simulation results from ABAQUS.
It should be used with Auswertungstool.fig and CP_Analyse.m.

Kontur.m is the main file for extraction of the edge information. It should be used in conjuction with Kontur.fig, Analysis.m and Analysis_SIMULATION.m. The first file is the GUI file of the programm. The latter two are the analytical functions for the main file.

You can do the test with the attached picture.

The usage for Kontur.m will be updated later. Thanks for your interest.
